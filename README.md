# Introduction – Seyitan Oluwaseitan

Hi, I’m **Seyitan**, a Cloud/DevOps Engineer with a background in History and International Studies. My journey into tech started out of curiosity and a strong desire to find opportunities in a growing field. Since then, I've built hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, containerization, automation, and now, technical writing.

Joining **WriteTechHub**, I’m looking forward to honing my writing skills, learning how to communicate complex technical topics more clearly, and building a portfolio of helpful content. I hope to become more confident in documenting processes, writing tutorials, and sharing knowledge in a way that helps both beginners and professionals in the DevOps space.

Ultimately, I’m here to grow, collaborate, and contribute meaningfully to the tech writing community. Let’s build together!
