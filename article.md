## Why Technical Writing?

Personally, while practicing with various DevOps tools, I relied on documentation to guide me through setups and configurations. As time passed, I realized that I could also write my own documentation not just for myself, but to help others understand what I’ve learned.

So I decided to learn how to write tutorials, document processes, and contribute helpful content with WriteTechHub's bootcamp.

## What I learned so far

Git and Github is a very important tool for versio control. 
Git branching is a powerful feature in Git that lets you create separate versions of your project so you can work on different tasks or features 
independently without affecting the main project.

More so, Git adds significant value to technical writing by enabling version control, collaboration, and traceability. It allows writers to track changes over time, revert to previous versions, and manage multiple drafts efficiently. With Git, teams can collaborate seamlessly by merging contributions from different authors while minimizing conflicts. It also provides a clear history of edits and comments, enhancing transparency and accountability in the writing process. Overall, Git ensures that technical documentation is organized, up-to-date, and easily maintainable, which is crucial for producing high-quality and reliable content.
