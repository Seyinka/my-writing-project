## Why Technical Writing?

Personally, while practicing with various DevOps tools, I relied on documentation to guide me through setups and configurations. As time passed, I realized that I could also write my own documentation not just for myself, but to help others understand what I’ve learned.

So I decided to learn how to write tutorials, document processes, and contribute helpful content with WriteTechHub's bootcamp.

## What I'ved learned so far

Git and Github is a very important tool for versio control. 
Git branching is a powerful feature in Git that lets you create separate versions of your project so you can work on different tasks or features 
independently without affecting the main project.
